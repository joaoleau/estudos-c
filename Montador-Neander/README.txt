Welcome to my repository! Here you'll find a Neander assembler that translates assembly code from the input file `entrada.asm` to executable machine code for the Neander architecture. The assembler is built using Flex and the C programming language. The resulting machine code is stored in the output file `saida.mem`. This tool simplifies the development process and facilitates working with Neander assembly code. Feel free to explore and contribute to the repository. Enjoy assembling Neander code effortlessly!
